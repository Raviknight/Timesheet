# CONTEXT.md

Living document. Updated at the end of every working session so the next
Claude (or future-you) can pick up without re-reading the whole chat history.

## Current state (as of May 18, 2026)

Refactored from a single 1800-line HTML file into a modular ES-module project
that bundles to a single distributable file for production. Same features as
before:

- Multi-segment daily entries (clock out for personal, clock back in later)
- Per-segment break deduction (> 5h on weekdays only)
- Pay period systems: weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, monthly, advanced
  (anchor date + custom cycle length)
- Time-off pools with Taken / Scheduled / Remaining split
- Paycheck tracking with YTD totals
- Companies + role scaffolding (owner/employee/supervisor/admin)
- Cross-device sync via Anthropic `window.storage`, falls back to
  `localStorage` for plain-file use

Seeded with Ravi's 128 daily entries (Dec 29, 2025 → forward) and 88 pay
records from `Time_Sheet_2026.xlsx`.

## What's in flight

Nothing in progress right now. The refactor is complete and tested.

## Next likely tasks

In rough priority order:

1. **Deploy to GitHub Pages.** README has the steps. Test on Ravi's phone +
   desktop and confirm sync works through Claude.ai mobile.
2. **Add unit tests** for `core/time.js` (segment math) and `core/period.js`
   (period systems). Vitest is the natural pick.
3. **Add a "Today" quick-add button** that pre-fills date and lets Ravi punch
   in/out without opening the full modal.
4. **Export to original Excel format.** Pull `openpyxl` shape into a JS xlsx
   writer (SheetJS) so Ravi can hand the file to his employer.
5. **Multi-tenant scaffolding pass.** Wire `auth/roles.js` capability checks
   into the UI so unauthorized views are hidden. No backend yet, just the
   plumbing.
6. **Backend planning.** Decide between Cloudflare Workers + D1 vs Supabase
   for the eventual multi-tenant version. See `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

## Decisions / open questions

- **Bundler:** esbuild is currently in the build script. Vite would be nicer
  but adds dependencies. Revisit if/when we add TypeScript.
- **TypeScript:** not yet. Add when the project crosses ~30 files or when we
  start the backend.
- **Tests:** Vitest looks like the right choice (works with ESM out of the
  box). Not yet set up.

## Things to NOT do

- Don't introduce React, Vue, or any frontend framework yet. Vanilla JS is
  enough for the current scope and keeps the bundle tiny.
- Don't add Tailwind. The hand-rolled CSS variables in `assets/styles.css`
  work in light + dark mode and total < 200 lines.
- Don't reach for a state management library. The single `state` object in
  `app.js` is fine for this size.

## Session log

### May 18, 2026 — Refactor to multi-file structure
- Split single-file `timesheet.html` into ES modules under `src/`
- Added esbuild build script that produces `dist/timesheet.html` (single
  distributable file)
- Wrote `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `README.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`,
  `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/EXCEL_LOGIC.md`
- Kept all previous functionality intact, including the 128-entry + 88-pay
  first-run seed

### Earlier sessions (summarized)
1. Built initial single-file HTML app from `Time_Sheet_2026.xlsx`. Five
   sheets analyzed: Data, Source, Dashboard, Sheet1, Calculator.
2. Added multi-segment entries (clock out for personal then back in), with
   the rule that break is deducted per segment, not per day.
3. Rebuilt pay-period config from "anchor date only" to a system selector
   (weekly / bi-weekly / semi-monthly / monthly / advanced).
4. Split time-off balance display into Taken / Scheduled / Remaining so
   future-dated PTO doesn't make it look like the pool is used up.
5. Reordered tabs: Pay Period is now the landing view.
